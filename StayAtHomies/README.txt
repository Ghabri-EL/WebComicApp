=== Story 1 ===

The code submitted displays our wireframe for the project and future features.

The GUI will have the buttons for the tools on the left hand side, the main story editor in the center and the storyboard at the bottom.
We used a BorderPane to structure the elements of the GUI, this allows us to select where we want to display our scenes.

The buttons use a "VBox" which keeps the buttons going vertically down the page.
The storyboard uses a "HBox" whiich keeps the storyboard horizontal.
The main.app_run.Main story editor as of right now is just an empty ListView.

If there isn't enough space for the buttons on screen, a scroll wheel appears. If you minimize the application by about half the size, a scroll wheel appears.

=== COMPLAINTS ===

I am writing in regards to our team contribution throughout the project , specifically about a team member Ryan Daly that has done no
work since the start of the team project . We have given Ryan many chances throughout the past few weeks to do some work or contribute in
discussions regarding each weeks sprint and he has done nothing . More so he has slowed us down due to taking on tasks and then disappearing
for days with no work done or letting us know he has done nothing . Due to this it was harder for us as a team to complete each weeks sprint
and go above and beyond when it comes to adding new functionalities to our application or fixing all bugs in time in between just 3 people .
And for these reasons me and my teammates , Niall McGurk and Gabriel Gherasim , feel these complaints and challenges should be taken in
consideration when awarding our grades .
