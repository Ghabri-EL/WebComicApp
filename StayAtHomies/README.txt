Team Name: StayAtHomies - User Report 1

The code submitted displays our wireframe for the project and future features.

The GUI will have the buttons for the tools on the left hand side, the main story editor in the center and the storyboard at the bottom.
We used a BorderPane to structure the elements of the GUI, this allows us to select where we want to display our scenes.

The buttons use a "VBox" which keeps the buttons going vertically down the page.
The storyboard uses a "HBox" whiich keeps the storyboard horizontal.
The Main story editor as of right now is just an empty ListView.

If there isn't enough space for the buttons on screen, a scroll wheel appears. If you minimize the application by about half the size, a scroll wheel appears.
